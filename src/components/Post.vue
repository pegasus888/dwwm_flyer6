      <h3 class="">What Is a Framework?</h3>
      <p class="mb-auto" style="text-align: justify">In the early days of web development, programmers hard coded everything using HTML and CSS. Websites were basic and frameworks were just beginning to be developed. Why were they being developed? Because programmers got sick and tired of writing out the same code and logic every time they started a new project. A framework is the natural result of software innovation. They’re basically prepackaged coding bits you can rely on over and over again to develop your software and web applications quickly.</p>

        <p class="text-white bg-altmyflamboyant mx-5">Angular,  Vue.js,  Spring,  Django,  Express,  Ruby on Rails,  Laravel,  Symfony</p>

      <h4 class=h3>Why Use a Framework?</h4>
      <p class="mb-auto" style="text-align: justify">Unless you’re coding an extremely simple website or software application, then you’ll probably want to use a framework to save time. Like, a massive amount of time. If you learn a framework like Angular or React, you’ll be able to write out a piece of code that relies on the innovations of numerous developers who’ve contributed to the framework. Of course, you could reinvent the wheel if you really feel like it, but we’re going to guess most people don’t want to do that.</p>

      <h5 class="h3">When Not to Use a Framework?</h5>
      <p class="mb-auto" style="text-align: justify">No framework is going to do everything for you. At most, the framework acts as a tool you need to know how to use. Nothing will replace fundamental programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Frameworks come and go—falling in and out of popular use—but good programming skills can last forever. Keep that in mind as you continue to look into learning frameworks.</p>
